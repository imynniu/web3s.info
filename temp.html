      <h4>MARLEY’S GHOST.</h4>
      <p>
        <span>Marley</span> was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever
        about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the
        clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
        Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put his
        hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
